# Pettify

This app is matches up potential pet owners to animal shelters
by providing a platform  for animal lovers to choose pets of their liking.

## How it Works

Users view pictures of animals currently being kept in shelters and can choose potential pets of their choice.
The animal shelters receive notification upon a user showing interest. At this point they can look at user profiles 
and choose if they approve. Upon approval, communication between the shelter and the user can commence.
